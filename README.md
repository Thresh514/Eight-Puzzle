# **Puzzle Solver App**

A Python-based GUI application for solving the classic 8-puzzle problem using various search algorithms.

---

## **Features**

- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface built with PyQt5.
- **Multiple Algorithms**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Greedy Search
  - A* Search
- **Custom Heuristics**:
  - Misplaced Tiles (`h1`)
  - Manhattan Distance (`h2`)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays the solution process step-by-step, including elapsed time and steps taken.
- **Stop Functionality**: Allows users to stop the solver mid-process.

## **Getting Started**

### **Requirements**

- Python 3.7 or later
- PyQt5

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

---

### **Running the Application**

1. Clone the repository or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/puzzle-solver-app.git
   cd puzzle-solver-app
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python puzzle_solver_app.py
   ```

3. Interact with the GUI:
   - Enter the initial board configuration (e.g., `123405678` where `0` represents the empty space).
   - Select the desired algorithm and heuristic.
   - Click **Solve Puzzle** to begin solving.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Enter the Puzzle**:
   - Input a 9-digit string representing the puzzle board. For example:
     ```
     1 2 3
     4 _ 5
     6 7 8
     ```
     would be entered as `123405678`.

2. **Choose the Algorithm**:
   - Select one of the available search algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, Greedy, A*).

3. **Select the Heuristic**:
   - For Greedy and A*, choose either:
     - `h1`: Misplaced Tiles
     - `h2`: Manhattan Distance

4. **Solve and View Progress**:
   - Watch as the solution is calculated step-by-step.
   - See the elapsed time and the number of steps taken.

5. **Stop**:
   - Use the **Stop** button to halt the process at any time.

```

---

## **Customization**

- **Styling**: Modify the `styles.qss` file to change the look and feel of the application.
- **Heuristics**: Add or modify heuristic functions in the `puzzle_solver_app.py` file.

---

## **Known Issues**

- Application may not run properly on macOS without bypassing Gatekeeper for unsigned apps.
- The `.app` file generated by `PyInstaller` requires extra steps to be opened by macOS users.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- Add support for larger puzzles (e.g., 15-puzzle).
- Optimize algorithms for better performance.
- Provide statistics comparing different algorithms.
